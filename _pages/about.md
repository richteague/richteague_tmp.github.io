I am currently an SMA Fellow at the _Center for Astrophysics \| Harvard & Smithsonian_.

Prior to this, I studied at the _University of Edinburgh_ for my MPhys in Astrophysics, then at the _Max Planck Institute for Astronomy_ in Heidelberg where I obtained my PhD in Astronomy, supervised by Prof. Thomas Henning and Dr. Dmitry Semenov. Afterwards, I moved to the _University of Michigan_, working in the group of Prof. Ted Bergin as a postdoctoral researcher.

### Research Outline

My research focusses on understanding and characterising the planet formation process using interferometric observations of simple molecular species. I tackle this problem from two angles. Firstly, I aim to constrain the physical and chemical properties of the planet formation environment and detail under what conditions planets form. Secondly, I search for subtle changes in the dynamical structure of the gas which can suggest the presence of a hidden protoplanet. By detecting the presence of young planets, we can directly compare the chemical diversity of their formation environment with those inferred from atmospheric studies of fully formed planets.

### Codes

Much of an astronomer's work revolves around writing code to explore the data, and my work is little different. I publish all my code on my [GitHub](https://github.com/richteague) page.
